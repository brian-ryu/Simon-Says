    <h4>Each round the board will play part of a sequence of colour flashes. Afterwards you are to play back the sequence of colour flashes in the exact order that they were played.<br>More and more of the sequence will be played each round.<br>If you mess up, the sequence will play again and you'll get another chance. But if you play in Strict Mode this opportunity is not available to you.</h4>
